description: The app is (almost) finished!

The app is now almost finished. I hope mr Waller will agree with me that it's good enough for now so that I can try to get going with my mandatory courses and not just this that I am doing just for fun. Or well, not only but this course have been great fun!

My main issue with this app right now is that if you pause in a game, then the countdown becomes a wee offset. I really hope I will have time to fix this later on, I opened an issue on Github so I don't forget it. I've decided that the app is now good enough to publish (it's probably just me who is using the old app anyway) so now you can find it at <a href="http://www.figurkoder.se/">figurkoder.se</a>.

Now I must shift focus to my main courses (and an old one that is still draging behind...) so that I finish them up before the deadline at January the 13th. Fingers crossed, even though I start to feel a bit worn after my <a href="https://github.com/OskarKlintrot">19 days streak on Github</a>. Unfortunately it looks like it will have to be 13 more days before I can rest. Or maybe fix that last course I have draging behind... Oh well, my aim is to write the last in-depth blog post before the end of January. Now at least you know why it will be a bit late. The post will be a comparsion between my previous app that where built in Typescript with Bootstrap, Mustache.js and jQuery and this app written in ES2015/2016 with React, Redux, React-MDL and what not. Something to look forward to! Any ideas on how to do the comparsion? I am all ears!
