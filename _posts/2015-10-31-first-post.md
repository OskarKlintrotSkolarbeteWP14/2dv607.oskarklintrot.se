I'm Oskar Klintrot, a 26 year old male from Klasentorp outside Alvesta but currently living in Väröbacka. I have a B.S. degree in marine engineering from KMA but fell in love with programming after doing some PLC programming at KMA. I have previously worked as an electrians, in a warehouse, in a store, 301 days at sea and most currently in the control room at the Scandinaviums largest power plant. Hence my excperience in programming is rather small. Despite that I'm aiming for a M.S. in CS. Yes, I'm blond!

My programming knowledge is the basics in:

* C# (Oh my, I'm a MS-fanboy now!)
  - ASP.NET WebForms
  - ASP.NET WPF
* PHP (I'm never doing it again!)
* JavaScript
  - jQuery
  - mustache.js
* TypeScript (Did I mention I'm a MS-fanboy?)
* PLC (I love it! If it's one company I love more than MS, it's gotta be ABB!)
  - ST
  - SFC
  - FBD
  - ABB AC500
  - ABB 800xA
* C/C++ (Very basic!)
  - Console application
  - Embedded system; Arduino

Misc:

* Modbus (kinda neat, almost no security at all though)

My aim with this course is to rebuild [figurkoder.se](http://figurkoder.se) and host it on GitHub-pages.
