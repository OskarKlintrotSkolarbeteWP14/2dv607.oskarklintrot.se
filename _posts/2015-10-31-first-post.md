Welcome to this blog! This is my first post!

I'm Oskar Klintrot, a 26 year old male from Klasentorp outside Alvesta but currently living in Väröbacka. I have a B.S. degree in marine engineering from KMA but fell in love with programming after doing some PLC programming at KMA. I have previously worked as an electrians, in a warehouse, in a store, 301 days at sea and most currently in the control room at the Scandinaviums largest power plant. Hence my excperience in programming is rather small. Despite that I'm aiming for a M.S. in CS.
