Welcome to this blog! This is my first post!

I'm Oskar Klintrot, a 26 year old male from Klasentorp outside Alvesta but currently living in Väröbacka. I have a B.S. degree in marine engineering from KMA but fell in love with programming after doing some PLC programming at KMA. I have previously worked as an electrians, in a warehouse, in a store, 301 days at sea and most currently in the control room at the Scandinaviums largest power plant. Hence my excperience in programming is rather small. Despite that I'm aiming for a M.S. in CS.

My programming knowledge is basics in:
* ASP.NET WebForms
* ASP.NET WPF
* JavaScript
  - jQuery
  - mustache.js
* TypeScript
* PLC
  - ST
  - SFC
  - FBD
  - ABB AC500
  - ABB 800xA

My aim with this course is to rebuild [figurkoder.se](http://figurkoder.se).
