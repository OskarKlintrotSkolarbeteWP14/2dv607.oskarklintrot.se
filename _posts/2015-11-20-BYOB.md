description: David Waller wanted me to try to implement bombs (or grenades, but that where a to long word for the app) to the demo app in order to get a better feeling for bom... Sorry, for Redux.

This post is about implementing bombs to the [demo app](http://blog.krawaller.se/riastart2015/). David Waller thought it would help me grasp the concept and structure of Redux better. I think it did. At least I had fun bombing the shit out of superman (Batman always wins when I play).

To start with the buttons needed to be bigger and get more space so in `css/style.css` I changed the code to this:

{% highlight CSS linenos=table %}
.battler {
	float: left;
	width: 125px;
	height: 205px;
	margin: 0.5em;
	border: 1px solid black;
	padding: 0.5em;
}

.battler button {
	width: 120px;
	text-align: left;
}

.battler button:nth-of-type(2n+1) {
	margin-bottom: 2px;
}

.battler button:nth-of-type(2n) {
	margin-bottom: 10px;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Next up I went to `src/components/battler.js` (or, I started there and changed the CSS along the way but hey this work flow sounds more professional) and added the property `bomb`. I also added buttons for bombing and controls:

{% highlight javascript %}
propTypes: {
	// ... //
	bomb: ptypes.func.isRequired
	// ... //
},
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight javascript %}
return 	<div>
					<button key={opp} onClick={p.kill.bind(this,opp)}>{"Shoot "+opp}</button>
					<button key={opp + "_bomb"} onClick={p.bomb.bind(this,opp)}>{"Bomb "+opp}</button>
				</div>;
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight javascript %}
var controls = {
	// ... //
	[C.BOMBING]: "sending bombs...",
	// ... //
}[p.doing[name]];
{% endhighlight %}

That code gave me an error to checkout `src/components/battlers.js`so I did that. I only had to add props and a functions so nothing to see there, it's more or less the same as above. Next error pointed me to `src/components/home.js` and once there it was the same old story again. Except that I also had to map the prop to a dispatch:

{% highlight javascript %}
var mapDispatchToProps = function(dispatch){
	return {
		bomb: function(killer,victim){ dispatch(actions.bombAt(killer,victim)); },
		// ... //
	};
};
{% endhighlight %}

I almost forgot! We have to add some stuff in `src/constants.js` as well!

{% highlight javascript %}
module.exports = {
	// ACTION TYPES
	BOMB_AT: "BOMB_AT",
	END_BOMB: "END_BOMB",
	// ... //

	// HERO STATUSES
	BOMBING: "BOMBING",
	// ... //
};
{% endhighlight %}

Puh, saved my ass there! Anyway... Where almost done now! Let us add an action to `src/actions.js` so that we can get in contact to our inner feelings (a.k.a. reducers):

{% highlight javascript %}
module.exports = {
  // ... //
  bombAt: function(killer,victim){
  	// Another async action using the Redux-thunk syntax
  	return function(dispatch,getState){
  		dispatch({type:constants.BOMB_AT,killer:killer,victim:victim});
  		setTimeout(function(){
  			dispatch({type:constants.END_BOMB,killer:killer,victim:victim});
  		}, 2000);
  	};
  }
};
{% endhighlight %}

As you can see, it's almost identical with `aimAt`. The idea is that we drop the bombs and then after a while the arrive to the victim and explodes. Good luck ducking that!

Now we have finaly arrived to the good parts, the logic! In our reducer `src\reducers\battlefield.js` we add two cases, one for sending the bombs and one for detonating the bombs!

{% highlight javascript %}
case C.BOMB_AT:
	newstate.doing[action.killer] = C.BOMBING;
	newstate.log.push(action.killer+" sends bombs to "+action.victim+"!");
	return newstate;
case C.END_BOMB:
	newstate.doing[action.victim] = C.DEAD;
	if (newstate.doing[action.killer] != C.DEAD) {
		newstate.doing[action.killer] = C.WAITING;
		newstate.log.push(action.killer+" celebrate the death of "+action.victim+"!");
	}
	else
		newstate.log.push(action.killer+" died before he could celebrate the death of "+action.victim+".");
	return newstate;
{% endhighlight %}

As you can see the killer dosen't even have to be alive once the bombs are on the go! Very effective! If you want you can check out the code [here](https://github.com/OskarKlintrot/riastart2015/tree/gh-pages) or why not try to bomb some superheros [here](http://oskarklintrot.github.io/riastart2015).
